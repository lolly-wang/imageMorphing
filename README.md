# imageMorphing
 CIS 581 course project
## To run

To implement my project, you can just call the main function in “test_script.py”. It will do the basic test first and morph my images.

To write 60 frame images into video, I  call “ imgeio.miwrite ”function. The result video is 4 seconds long with fps=15.
